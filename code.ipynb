    "This sweetviz report quickly tells us a few things about the dataset:\n",
    "1. There are 67115 cases where there is a missing policy status, since this is our dependent variable, rows which are missing here should be removed. This number of 67115 is also present in a lot of the other variables as such it backs up this thought. There are also 16 Unknown policies, since this is such a low number we can afford to remove them as well\n",
    "2. There are some irrelevant columns which only have one option such as PAYMENT_FREQUENCY and CAMPAIGN_DESC which is all missing.\n",
    "3. There are a number of variables that are majority missing, more analysis will be undertaken for these but it is expected that most will be dropped before modelling.\n",
    "4. There are a number of date variables, which should be put through feature engineering before we add them to our model\n",
    "5. Some columns are very heavily skewed so to consider whether these should be considered for the model or not\n",
    "6. There are some numerical columns such as SUM_INSURED_CONTENTS/SUM_INSURED_BUILDING that are more ordinal than continuous so should be encoded as such\n",
    "7. There are very strong associations between a lot of the columns, particularly around pre renewal and post renewal columns which highlights perhaps they should be combined. As well as sum assured and premium columns which are very strongly linked. The dataset should go through a rigourous feature selection process before being used for modelling to iron out as much of these correlations as possible\n",
    "8. There are some outliers which will need looking at in more detail"
